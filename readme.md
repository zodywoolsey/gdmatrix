# gdmatrix

Makes implementing Matrix into Godot 4.x projects easier.

## notice:

this is not complete but includes quite a bit of functionality already. i will be updating this to make it more generalized as it might rely on some barkvr specific things right now.

- login with username/password
- caches exisiting logins to disk automatically
- (wip) simple route for binding UI to recieved events (all the methods for responding to events are in one place)

i am already working on a code generator that will be able to take the api.json from the matrix spec repos to generate the api network calls
